# Aqua-Polis

To do:

Mati:
- [x] website, 
- [ ] user guide
- [x] prototype and print

Salman:
- [ ] encription
- [x] video script

Sam:
- [x] map and user
- [ ] video editing

Martin:
- [x] led
- [ ] datasheet about threading and co

All: 
- [ ] video
- [ ] testing and demo simulation

--communication--
- [x] Com raspberry-broker
- [x] Com sensors-raspberry
- [x] Com rasp-server
- [x] Com server-app
- [ ] Encription


--basic functionality--
- [x] Sensors
- [x] Server
- [x] Broker
- [x] Raspberry  
- [x] ML model (Neural, classification problem, trained on dataset and test on new data uploaded)


--high level deliverables--
- [x] Web app
- [ ] Mobile app
- [x] general page
- [-] User login info
- [x] User location
- [x] Data analysis and statistics
- [ ] User guide (stir and move it around, 10*10 average), led lights signals
- [x] Map (When creating the map need to select what source of water used e.g. Tap, river, fountain..)
- [x] socials
- [ ] video
- [x] video script
- [x] prototype and print


--Sensor hardware and power--
- [x] Turbidity
- [x] TDS
- [x] LED 
- [x] button
- [[]] Advanced model: Battery, More sensors, Temperature compensation ?
- [ ] !! Connection safety (mqtt QOS type 2, highest level of service), missing connection on raspberry pi, flashing red light
- [x] error handling more on range of sensor values?

-- Marketing page --
- What: potability and water security (data to stress on the urgency of this problem)
- Where: urban and rural areas application
- When: anytime sensor functionality plus additional features with stable network
- Why: social target, water quality problem and safe water sources
- Who: costumer target, anyone who has this device and a phone
- Marketing analysis

-- Advanced --
- [x] Event queue (wait for ml result in a lopp ...)
- [x] threading (2 sensors, 1 bus, threading with led and button, reading + website server?)
- [x] Calibration
- [[]] Additional sensors
- [x] CAD prototype
- [x] Second marketing page with advanced version (only prototype due to external project constraints)
- [x] Creative way of using Python classes (ML model)
